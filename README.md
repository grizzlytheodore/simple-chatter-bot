# Simple-Chatter-Bot

Personal Project. This program is very basic machine learning. I can talk to the machine. If I say something it has never seen before, the machine will repeat back the same phrase to me and see what I say. Then the next time I say that sentense, the program will reply the same way I did. 
Open source program called eSpeak is implemented in this program. The program can vocally answer back along with text.
